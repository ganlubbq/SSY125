function [ coded_bits ] = conv_encode( bits,G )
%CONV_ENCODE Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
%   use convolution code defined by G to encode bits.
%   both bits and coded_bits are row vectors
%   G = [G1;G2;G3], where G1,G2,G3 are the coefficient of the boolean polynomial
